# CryptoClustering - Unsupervised Learning
In this challenge, the purpose was to use Python and supervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by price changes.

1) Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame using the elbow method
2) Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
3) Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
4) Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
5) Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
